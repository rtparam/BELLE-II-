# BELLE-II-
Particle Physics 
Data analysis of particle-antiparticle flavour oscillations of $B^0$ meson of simulated data from BELLE-II detector at Super-KEKB accelerator. Involves reconstruction of the decay of the $B^0$ meson in the steps of the decay chain by reconstructing the invariant mass of the particles and calculation of asymmetry function, oscillation frequency and dilution.
