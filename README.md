# BELLE-II-
Particle Physics 
Data analysis of particle-antiparticle flavour oscillations of $B^0$ meson of simulated data from BELLE-II detector at Super-KEKB accelerator. Involves reconstruction of the decay of the B0
meson in the steps of the decay chain by reconstructing the invariant mass of the particles and calculation of asymmetry function, oscillation frequency and dilution.
